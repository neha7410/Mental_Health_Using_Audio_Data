# model training

In this folder, several files have been written to generate the results presented in the final year report:
* [classifierWithFS.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/classifierWithFS.py): This python script is the main script written for either binary classification task, multi-class classification task and generate some visualizations of the data. To run it, can just run "python classifierWithFS.py". Feel free to change to file paths too. A list of models and audio features set are reviewed in this script. To start understanding what this script is doing, you can start by looking at the main() function. Feel free to choose which function to run.
* [inputs.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/inputs.py): This python file handles and validates the input of x and y files.
* [plotting.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/plotting.py): Most of the cpde fpr visualization of data include the distribution of data, the visualization of the result (bar graph), the sine wave of the audio signal are written here.
* [classifierGenerateTable.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/classifierGenerateTable.py): It generates csv files that record the effects of **unnormalized** mean/mean + std/ mean + std after feature selection of audio features to models.
* [proposedClassifierGenerateTable.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/proposedClassifierGenerateTable.py): It generates csv files that record the effects of **normalized** mean/mean + std/ mean + std after feature selection of audio features to models.
* [regressor.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/regressor.py): Based on some functions written in classifierWithFS.py, it generates the regression result using the optimal audio features found for binary classification task.
* [featureComparison.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/featureComparison.py): It visualizes the difference of normalization techniques with our proposed technique.
* [plot_adaboost_multiclass.py](https://github.com/chanjunweimy/FYP_Submission/blob/master/code/model%20training/plot_adaboost_multiclass.py): Modified from the online template, it shows the strength of boosting (AdaBoost) to our problem set.
